.SYNOPSIS
    Builds VL.NetTopologySuite and stages it under dist\.

.DESCRIPTION
    A package is a .vl at the repo root with a .nuspec of the same name beside it. They are
    discovered rather than listed, so adding a second one needs no edit here. Ported from
    vvvv-gis, which is built the same way.

        dist\VL.NetTopologySuite\
          VL.NetTopologySuite.vl           <- entry point (nodes appear in the NodeBrowser)
          VL.NetTopologySuite.nuspec       <- required for vvvv to recognise a source package
          lib\net8.0\*.dll|.xml
          help\**

    That is the same shape a published package has once installed under
    %LOCALAPPDATA%\vvvv\gamma\nugets\<id>.<version>\, so "works locally but not once
    published" cannot happen.

    dist\ is the package *repository*; each folder inside it is a package. Point vvvv at the
    repository, not at a package:

        vvvv.exe --package-repositories D:\2026_Projects\vl-nettopologysuite\dist

    Which DLLs get staged is driven by the .vl's <PlatformDependency> entries, so dist\ always
    contains exactly what the document declares.

    The entry point being a real package rather than a ProjectDependency is also what lets VL
    build nodes whose signatures mention NetTopologySuite types: VL learns a foreign library's
    types from the <NugetDependency> lines in the .vl, and without them such a node is silently
    never created. That is why this script exists before the interesting nodes do.

    That failure is total for this package rather than partial. Every node here takes or returns
    an NTS type, so an unresolvable NetTopologySuite means the package contributes nothing at all
    - and vvvvc still exits 0 with nothing red anywhere.
