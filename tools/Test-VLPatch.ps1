.SYNOPSIS
    Validates .vl patch documents structurally, without needing vvvv.

.DESCRIPTION
    Test-VLPackage.ps1 checks the package: that the entry point exists, forwards an assembly with
    [ImportAsIs], and declares its nugets. It does not look inside a help patch. This does.

    Every check here corresponds to a failure that is SILENT in vvvv - the patch opens, nothing is
    red, and something simply does not work:

      BOM              a .vl without a UTF-8 BOM is not loaded at all
      ID format        22 chars, first [A-V] - vvvv's deserializer rejects anything else quietly
      ID uniqueness    duplicates make one node shadow another
      link endpoints   a Link naming an ID that is not a Pin or Pad is dropped without warning
      dangling IOBox   a Pad connected to nothing is decoration the user cannot use - EXCEPT an
                       annotation box, which carries its own Value and no Comment. That is the
                       shipped convention for explanatory text and is allowed on purpose
      empty Path IOBox Value="" on a Path means the DOCUMENT'S OWN FOLDER, not "empty" - this is
                       the one that wrote 444 files next to two repositories with every guard
                       reporting success

    It cannot tell you whether a node resolves: that depends on what the assembly actually exports,
    and only the GUI proves a node appears under the expected category. A PASS here means the
    document is well formed, not that it works.
